## To run:
1. Copy repo from github as usual–use personal github, not Cornell (to avoid Docker restrictions)
2. Use: “docker compose up –-build” not “npm install” to initialize npm dependencies (tested for npm run ios, unsure if docker setup works for npm run android)
3. cd to the inner influx-app
4. “npm run ios” or “npm run android” to run simulator
5. Side note: reminder to “git pull” before modifying
